    "- 1. Version Control for Data & Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional GitHub works well for code but struggles with large datasets and model binaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "DagsHub integrates Git + DVC (Data Version Control) to manage datasets and ML models efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Experiment Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrates with MLflow to log experiments (hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes comparing different ML runs easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensures that anyone can reproduce results by combining code, data, and environment dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like GitHub, but designed for ML teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams can share datasets, trained models, pipelines, and experiments in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5. Open Source Friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "Many open-source ML projects use DagsHub because it provides free hosting and tracking for datasets, models, and experiments."
